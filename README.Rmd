Implementation of TITE-PK 
=========================
This is the accompanying code to paper "Phase I dose-escalation trials with more than one dosing regimen"
by BK GÃ¼nhan, S Weber, A Seroutou, and T Friede.
See the Preprint version: 

TITE-PK 
=======
TITE-PK (a time-to-event pharmacokinetic model) is a method for designing and analyzing 
phase I dose-escalation trials with dose-regimen changes, eg a daily and weekly dosing.
Hence, it is a model-based approach for dose-escalation trials like the Bayesian Logistic
Regression Model, but TITE-PK is able to integrate varying dosing regimens. For details, 
see the preprint.

Computations
============
TITE-PK uses **Stan** via `Rstan`, hence it should be installed. 
See [here](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started)
for how to install it.

`TITEPK_run.R` is the main R-script which produce the Figure 2 of the main text
for TITE-PK methods.

`tite_pk_one_param.stan` and `tite_pk_two_params.stan` are main **Stan** scripts
which are used in `TITEPK_run.R` to implement the TITE-PK models.
